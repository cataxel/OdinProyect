    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>a small cake baked in a cup-shaped container and typically iced.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>120g butter, softened</li>
        <li>120g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>120g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>140g butter, softened</li>
        <li>275g icing sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>A few drops of food colouring (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and mix into the butter mixture along with the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Fold in the flour, adding a little milk until the mixture is of a dropping consistency. Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until they are three quarters full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into one of the cakes comes out clean. Set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes. Then place on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>For the buttercream icing, beat the butter until soft. Add half the icing sugar and beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining icing sugar with 1 tbsp milk, adding more milk if necessary, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add food colouring (optional) and mix well.</li>
        <li>Spoon the buttercream into a piping bag and add a nozzle of your choice. Pipe in a swirl motion and then enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
